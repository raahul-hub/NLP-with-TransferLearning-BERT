# NLP-with-TransferLearning-BERT

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for sentiment analysis on textual data using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models. The implementation covers various stages of the natural language processing pipeline, including preprocessing, BERT model creation using TensorFlow HUB, tokenization, obtaining pretrained embedding vectors for reviews, applying neural networks for classification, and establishing a robust data pipeline for BERT models.

## 1. Preprocessing

Before feeding text data into the BERT model, it's crucial to preprocess the data for optimal performance. The preprocessing step includes tasks such as text cleaning, handling special characters, and managing word contractions. This ensures that the input data is in a suitable format for subsequent stages in the pipeline.

## 2. Creating a BERT Model from TensorFlow HUB

This repository leverages TensorFlow HUB to create a BERT model efficiently. TensorFlow HUB provides a collection of pre-trained models, making it easy to integrate powerful language models into your project. The BERT model chosen here serves as a robust foundation for extracting contextualized embeddings from input text.

## 3. Tokenization

Tokenization is a crucial step in preparing text data for BERT models. The repository incorporates tokenization techniques to break down input text into smaller units, enabling the model to understand the contextual relationships between words. This step is essential for effective natural language understanding and processing.

## 4. Obtaining Pretrained Embedding Vectors

The implementation fetches pretrained embedding vectors for a given review from the BERT model. These vectors capture rich semantic information about the input text, providing a meaningful representation for downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis.

## 5. Applying Neural Networks for Classification

To classify reviews based on sentiment, the repository employs neural networks. The pretrained embedding vectors obtained from BERT serve as input features for the classification task. The neural network architecture is designed to effectively learn and generalize patterns in the data, enabling accurate sentiment classification.

## 6. Creating a Data Pipeline for BERT Model

A robust data pipeline is established to streamline the integration of the BERT model into your workflow. This includes data loading, preprocessing, and model inference steps, providing a seamless and efficient process for analyzing sentiment in textual data.
